<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<!-- 
[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)
-->
Five-card Draw is a playable Python poker application. This project served as a hands-on Python learning experience in 2021. On my journey, I learned about creating graphical user interfaces in Python, pythonic best practices, CI/CD workflows, PyPi deployments, and much more. The beautiful learning opportunity this project provided was balancing desired learning opportunities and refining 5 Card Draw into a polished application. This project archived with the last remaining features involved in further polishing the UI/UX experience, adding sound, and cashing out player credits. If I were to start over, I'd rank poker hands with a semantic system over an integer score.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage / How to Play
If your python files open with Python by default then from the commmand line run:

  ```js
  poker_start.py;
  ```

Troubleshooting:
* "'poker_start.py' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file."
  * Your terminal needs to be able to find the file. For windows, you need to ensure your python "script" folder is in your path variable
  For example: C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\Python\{pythonversion}\Scripts
  You may also navigate to where the pip was installed and run poker_start.py with python manually.

How to Play:
* The game is played by aiming to make the best poker hand possible. The top of the interface shows the hand ranking and the payouts sorted by how many credits you bet per round, 1 thru 5. To begin, click DEAL. You hold cards with the intent of keeping them and drawing new cards to try to improve your hand ranking. After drawing new cards, your hand is automatically scored and profits paid out. You may then click "DEAL" and start over.
